                        <p>
                            The initial idea I generated during the course discussion is to build a fuel price checker and predictor, I randomly checked some of the datasets and find the fuel price data set with good format and a relatively larger amount. It is an ideal training set to start up a machine learning model. I just complete my machine learning study on Coursera so can’t help to think about how to make use of these data to build a machine learning model.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the course discussion, the group brainstormed on several topics and some of my classmates found some other related data on Queensland Government data sets, including fuel types, vehicle registration, traffic load, etc. After class, I expanded the topic into “Driving in Queensland”, aimed to provide a one-stop traffic information portal for drivers in Queensland.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide pic_top">
                        <img src="./images/website_draft.jpg">
                        <p>
                            Based on the above idea I tried to make a mock-up of the website homepage. The target users can be different types of drivers including car drivers, motorcycle drivers, and truck drivers. However, I later dropped this idea when I find it is hard to justify the user scenario.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Drivers do not have a PC with internet access when driving. The website seems not of use if it’s not designed with a mobile-first experience. As a newbie in web design, I’m not confident to start with a mobile site. So I switched my topic to “weekend planner”.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To start all over again, I checked the Padlet board for the course discussion again. One of the discussion notes talked about some upcoming firework show. This inspired me about thinking about making an event index. Not only limited to fireworks but also other types of events, for example, Art Gallery Events. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To create an easy to use front-end interaction, I’m thinking of some keyword search. From my machine learning course, there’s easy access to achieve this using word embedding. Giving some keywords, the algorithm can return a word representing the most related event name in the event word list. The backend can then search the datasets by using the generated event name.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thinking of the target user, it can be any ordinary people who don't have a clear clue about what to do this weekend. This website can be helpful for them to get some hints. And thinking about the user scenario, users may want to have a quick answer in less than 10 minutes because it is not something serious and need to spend a lot of time on it.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide pic_top">
                        <img src="./images/weekend_mock.jpg">
                        <p>
                            Since the overall interaction happens within a very short time frame, the UI needs to be as simple as possible. Inspired by Padlet, the sticky notes seems an easy way to add some random keywords.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When designing the mockup, I realize that the website must provide a share function. Often people are spending their weekends with friends, family, or significant other. So the planner needs to offer some flexibility for mobile access when a PC user sharing with someone without a PC for the moment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After having the website mockup ready, the next step is to organize them into a poster. The left side is introducing the website itself while the right side is telling a story using a WhatsApp chat history. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To not beak the aesthetics, I did not use the ordinary format of a storyboard. Instead, the chat history format is telling the story well enough with sufficient detail for the audience to know how to interact with the website.

                                    The final grading is not as good as my expectation, I get 7.08 out of 10. I would not put it as a success. The feedbacks point out there’s some missing part including a persona defining the target audience and a formatted reference session. The presentation and visual aids are considered concise and clear.
                                    </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    I’m not satisfied with the grading at first, but after examining the feedback, the reasons for grading are well explained. It’s convincing that the target audience part and reference style needs to be improved.
                                    </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The poster and pitch is a good experience to start ideating a design topic. It makes me think of how to find a topic, identifying the target audience, thinking of the user scenario, and finally, how to present the idea to other people. I’m now more confident to start a new website design with this experience. 
                                    </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    When designing the poster, I always put aesthetics in the first position but ignoring some of the key deliverables in the assessment requirement. The target audience is a large user group but it’s not the excuse that I failed to give a clear scope of them. I should explain it more clearly. For example, an officer who wants to find something to do at the weekend or university students.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    In conclusion, the target audience and reference style should be at a higher priority since they are one of the key requirements of this design activity. 
                                    </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    I need to prioritize all the elements to be included in the design and fulfill them by sequence. If some trade-off is to make, always secure the one with higher priority. The grading can be a reminder for me to always think about what’s the most important thing to do before taking action.

                                The first team meeting I hosted is to do ideation for the team topic. Before starting, I checked with my teammates about their chosen topic in design exploration assessment. After considering the difficulty of implementation and the attractiveness of the topic itself, the team narrowed down the topics into either marine pollution or dangerous animals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I asked the team to prepare their card sorting for their preferred topic. Since this time we need to consider the implementation, as the only member with coding experience, I provided my opinion on a technical perspective.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After voting during the team meeting, we decide to go with dangerous animals. And the scope of MVP is defined in the same team meeting through brainstorming. Above is a link to the Miro board for our ideation.

                                As the project manager, I followed PMP methodologies to identify the work packages and put them into a Gantt diagram. The task allocation is defined through discussion during the team meeting.

                                In the above work packages, the assignee as Team means the team will do it together through collaboration. Assignee as individual means each team member is allocated with part of the task. For example, we need to do aesthetic design for different pages, each member is in charge of one specific page.

                                        The overall feedback in grading covers many aspects. The presentation is surely a success, again the visual aids and presentation skills are approved by the tutors. However, the data set and the target audience is not justified well. Also, on the Padlet board, we see some feedbacks pointing out our aesthetic design is not consistent.

                                        The final grading is acceptable but not ideal for me. However, the sections we lose marks are not assigned to me so I should respect my teammates’ efforts. As the team leader, I find it a little bit hard to balance the feeling of every teammate since people do provide deliverables with different qualities.

                                        I’m new to the experience of leading a student group. I did lead some business groups before but since everyone gets paid it’s common to point out the defects of their work directly. Things become tricky in the student groups because I need to keep the motivation for every group member.

                                        As a team lead, I’m not able to complete or review all works from my group members. I need to focus on facilitating my group member’s collaboration and making a decision on certain points. Also, I need to oversee the consistency of the team deliverables.

                                        Overall the team keeps motivated and keeps relatively high productivity for the later assessments. But still, I need to spend extra time on the overall quality of our team deliverables.

                                    <p>
                                        I have learned that as the leader role I should spend more time helping my teammates complete their work if the quality is not ideal, rather than overwrite the whole section and do it myself. This will reduce the workload in later phases and help to advance the skill level for both.

                                Similar to part A planning, I drafted the Gantt diagram and explained the tasks to my teammates. Since the development starts from this phase, the action items need to be tracked daily and group members need a place updating their progress, so I created a spreadsheet for tracking purposes. Action items 1-46 are for part B and all defined by me.

                                After the task allocation, as the lead developer, I defined the architecture of our website with the necessary technologies explained in the following Miro board. Considering the skill set of the team, I decided to use Python, PHP, and MySQL as our backend. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for frontend.

                                After the architecture is defined, next thing is to set up our team zone. As the lead developer, I’m installed python 3.8 with PIP, Pandas, Requests, and MySQL connector libraries for our team zone. Also, I configured MySQL and PHP to make them function in our team zone. Somehow the package provided by UQ zone ‘webproj’ image is problematic for us. Fortunately, the team zone is a Ubuntu system so basically I did the configuration through ‘sudo apt-get’ method.

                                The backend is developed by me using python. The basic idea is to retrieve the WildNet API data using Python request library, then write them into a CSV file for human reading using the Pandas library, and by the same time write the data into MySQL using MySQL connector library.

                                I also coded the template for the animal detail page. The key part is to retrieve data from the MySQL database and put them into an HTML table. And I defined the CSS for this page to achieve the aesthetic design.

                                        During the implementation process, the server of WildNet API is not available for three days. This is when I start coding for the backend. I have to postpone the development process until the server is back online.
                                        </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I thought it was my code’s problem the first time fail to retrieve the data. But after several rounds of testing on the URL of other APIs, I figure out that it’s the server’s problem. I’m quite surprised and thinking of a solution to deal with this situation if it happens during our final presentation. 
                                        </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                    I planned to call the API directly before this incident, however, it can be problematic if this occurs once more. 
                                       </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        The solution leads to our final architecture. The data is stored in the MySQL database and the website is retrieving data from there. This solution is robust and with higher availability. However, to achieve this, I have to spend more time building a complex backend module and it requires more time for development.
                                        </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Now the API server-side is no longer affecting the availability of the website itself.
                                        </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        This incident makes me think of how technical structures can impact the performance of the website. Also, from a project management perspective, there’s always a trade-off between a robust system and a short development cycle.

                                After part B, we received some useful feedback. We want to absorb some of them into our MVP. Also, the voting function for the Ranking page is not ready and consider complicated. To complete our final product in time, I hosted a team meeting for scope refinement. The decision is to add an interactive game on our homepage to increase interactivity and to make the vote function a simulator.

                                The ranking page is to present the voting outcome for different animals and show their ranking. In the part B demonstration, it’s just a static HTML page. However, to make it functional, the ranking of animals needs to be retrieved dynamically from the server. The original design is using MySQL to store all the data including the votes cast. To simplify the solution, I used the d3 library for JavaScript to parse a CSV file on the server. The voting information is stored in the file. The d3 library offers an easy method for me to parse the CSV file and generate HTML elements dynamically.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also, the HTML elements generated need to have interactions for casting votes and linking to the animal detail pages. The method d3 offered is an async data retrieving method very much like AJAX. Which makes it difficult to simply add interactions like $(“.animal”).click(). The workaround is to add the interactions after the generation of the HTML element itself.

                                In part B presentation we received feedback saying that the whole website is lacking interaction. The team thinks it would be better to add in more interactive elements. So a “who am I” guessing game is added to the homepage. I coded for this section using pure JavaScript controlling the visibility of different HTML elements.

So I did proofreading for the whole document and made some modifications to the paragraphs not align with the rest of the document.

                                        Time management becomes a big issue for the last part. When the semester coming to an end, time is very limited for many tasks. The to-do list is getting longer and longer. To get ready for the final tradeshow, I have to complete the code and do the rehearsal at the same time. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                        I’m very stressed when doing part C. I’m afraid that unexpected incidents happened and suddenly broke our website. Luckily it does not happen. We delivered the trade show successfully and had a great time with our visitors.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Everything was completed just in time without any buffer. If possible I do not want to experience that again. I should have left more buffer to myself and offload more responsibilities to my teammates. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        The reason for me stressing myself so much is that I do not have enough trust in my teammates. Although I’m the lead developer, I should leave more front end coding to my teammates. 
                                        </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>
                                        I survived this semester without issue but it’s just luck. If any severe last-minute bug occurs I would not be able to fix them. 
                                        </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>
                                        Next time I would like to trust more on my teammates. Trust will boost team collaboration and everyone can benefit.

                                        This is the 1st semester for me in UQ, and starting remotely makes me feel a little bit not connected. The reason I choose this course is that during orientation, the faculty mentioned for Master of IT students it's better to enroll in this course in 2020 S2, otherwise it would only be available in 2021 S2.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Before the course start I know little about this course, the only expectation is that I will be learning web design and will be implementing a website on my own. By reading through the ECP, I realize that this course requires some teamwork to build a website together, and also the data supporting the website is from the real-world. So probably I will need to implement an API to retrieve data.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I want to learn web design skills to build a nice and clean front-end for my application. Especially, the web development skills. I'm good at designing my presentation slides, or some posters in my experience. I want to acquire the ability to build a good user interface. It's much easier for my potential users to access the content I want to deliver if they are pleased with the interaction.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Since this is my first semester, I'm concerned about my website development skills. I haven't complete DECO7140 which is a prerequisite for this course. I know something about HTML5 but haven't touched CSS and JavaScript yet. I will try to do some self-learning in advance to facilitate the project in this course. I do have many ideas, but my website development skill is not sufficient to bring them to live online.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>
                                        I hope that I can lead the team project. I got a PMP license years ago but haven't got a chance to manage a project on my own. Here I want to test my skills to manage the process of website development, communicate with different people, and make them work together. I do meet some brilliant people in this course and we have some offline chat after the course. As students in this course, we share variant backgrounds, someone got an EE bachelor's degree, while someone got Mathematic. It will be great if we can maximize our team collaboration using their knowledge.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                        I found the ideation exercise helpful. I didn't know there's so much data available online, more important, they are free. I spent a lot of time looking for meaningful data when I was doing machine learning, never find such high-quality sources. With these data, I can do many things around it. E.g. a wave reporter, a traffic predictor, or anything else. And they provided APIs to better facilitate IT systems, that's amazing.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>
                                        After the 1st week, my expectation has adjusted a little bit. I learned that this is a design course rather than a development course. The core is to develop skills of user-centered thinking and generate design ideas that suitable for the given scenario. I may advance my web developing skills, but more importantly, is to have a clear sense of how to design and structure the front-end experience. In the meantime and I can practice my teamwork skills and make some friends. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Some goals here are: improve user-centered design thinking, mastering the usage of the web API, mastering CSS, be confident writing JavaScript, advance my skills using PS &amp; Ai.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                        I didn't receive feedback during the contact. But when later I meet up with my group members to discuss our team topic, some of my team members provided a nice point. She says the poster reuses too much of the similar designs, and the placeholder text is not informative enough to show what would be presented on the result page.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        This makes me consider why I reused so many similar pages. I didn't intend to do that. Initially, I just planned to put a one-page poster that simply introduces my idea. But later I decided to add in persona and storyboard. I made an individual page to include the story. However, I did not make any changes to the previous page. This makes the whole poster inconsistent in a sense. I make use of the same mockup as the first page in my user story. So overall the poster gives the viewer a feeling that too much-reused materials appear.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        The good thing about doing so is that it saves a lot of time. But a strong side-effect is introduced since the over-reused visual elements give the reader a perception that this website is lacking content. It looks like there are no sufficient details to support the concept, or the concept itself has some flaws that I'm trying to avoid.
                                        </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        It reminds me that during the website design if I want to add or remove something, better to rethink the integrity of the whole website. Think about the implication that a modification may have on the big picture, before action. This will improve the final work quality. And be cautious about the repeating elements, unless there's a certain level of necessity, do not make something appear twice or more.
                                        </p>
                                </li>

                                        In conclusion, now I'm thinking of doing better planning and sectioning before doing the work. Using techniques like card sorting and visual organizing to have a more concrete idea before designing. List out all the contents I want to put on the website, and try to categorize in a logical order, reduce the recurrence. And of course, before making any modification, think about the big picture again, to keep the consistency of the whole design.
                                        </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        The action plan for the future if I encounter a similar situation would be when adding on more elements to the existing design, find out the contents before doing visual organization. Do a mock-up and examine with the existing part, to keep integrity, and then make the design according to the mock-up.

                                        During the last few weeks, the one key milestone we were working on is the group design report and pitch. Our group topic is dangerous animals. We divided the website into several components and each group member worked on one of them. I focused on the detail page of each animal, collect animal information, and structure them onto a single page. Then we put our mock-up together and build a prototype. We drafted a design document based on the prototype and discussed the possible interaction in detail. During the contact session, we received some valuable feedbacks and later we made some adjustments during the weekend. Wei-Ning and I prepared the presentation. I was focused on the introduction session and Wei-Ning focused on the demo session. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        I was confident about the presentation as we spent a lot of time preparing. We controlled the pace well during the rehearsal. However, the previous groups did a really good job, especially in aesthetic design on ppt slides. This stressed me up. I was relieved a bit after we complete the presentation right hit the time limit. After all, I'm glad to see that the feedbacks are mostly positive, talking about the well-completed prototype and usage of bread crumb. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        I did provide my feedbacks to many of the groups. And when comparing my feedbacks with the feedbacks we received, I find that the focus point of our group is very much different from most groups. We spent most of our time on prototyping rather than the presentation. We could have made a stronger presentation if we spend more time on presentation materials. One of the tutors talked about the consistency issue in our design. Pages are designed by different group members, we do not have an overall aesthetic guide. This hit our weakness right on the bull's eye. 
                                        </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Comparing pages designed by different group members, the fonts are very much different across them. Also the padding and color preference and not consistent. Other than the elements on the design images, the group members are using various software creating the mockup, including AI, XD, and Sketch. 
                                        </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        We are thinking of making some components global to increase consistency, such as header and footer. Furthermore, the theme color of red and black will be applied. We can simply use the PHP include() function to replicate the global components on every page. Each page will modify to adapt to the aesthetic of them. 
                                        </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        This makes me rethink my approach to organizing team activities. Previously I would set a target date for individual tasks and put them on the project plan. Most tasks are complete by individuals and team discussion only happens when everyone has completed their task. This makes it very hard to keep a consistent design style since we only talk to other members when we completed the design not during the design process. In the future, team workshops may be encouraged to do design/coding together with team members.

                                    Looking back on the expectation I wrote in Journal 1, my expectation is simply to gain the essential skill to build front-end for my applications. Now I’m familiar with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and capable of implementing various interactions on the front-end. As a result, the learning expectation is achieved.
                                    </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    I’m now confident about basic front-end coding and want to learn more about advanced toolkits such as vue or react. I get a sense of fulfillment every time I achieved some cool visual effects on my website.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    More than meeting the original expectation, now I know more about the strategies to start web design, such as prototyping, user testing, etc. I can say it exceeds my expectation.
                                </p>

                                    I did spend a huge amount of time on this course during the semester and the improvement of my skills is significant. As the project manager and lead developer, I have to spend extra time on team coordination and technical exploration. It’s tough but fun.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Generally speaking, the time paid off. I’m satisfied with the learning outcome after all. During the learning process, I higher my learning expectation to focus more on interactive design. I make use of this course as the entrance point for thinking about user interactions.
                                    </p>

                                    In the future, I would try to make use of the skills I learned here to advance my career life. And to create more valuable things that may help other people.

                                    I would like to simply categorize the learning of this course into two parts, skill and knowledge. Knowledge is about the strategies to improve web design such as card sorting, persona, storyboard, etc. Skill is about the usage of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and PHP. To make use of different tools building up a functional website. As a result, I gained more on the skill side. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The learning process is not as pleasant as the outcome. The bad side of IT is sometimes it works but you never know why sometimes it doesn’t work and no one knows why. All I need is a huge amount of time for coding and a little bit of luck. And some deep breath against frustration.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The outcome is somehow satisfactory as I mentioned in the expectation session. The skill improvements are mostly learn-by-doing. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Since I do not have any experience as a front-end developer, I’m not able to combine the knowledge part with experience. Sometimes it becomes abstract to me. Yet the skill side is more concrete and can be examined at once. 
                                    </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    The course expanded my vision in the web design domain. I feel I’m on the right track building up a good foundation as a front-end developer.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    In the future, I would like to put a front-end development framework onto my to-do list and try to have a better overall understanding of web design.

                                    The possible improvements for me as an individual is very much covered in the reflection session for each assessment. Here I would like to suggest some possible improvements to the institution. All students in this course need to implement their work on a VM provide by the faculty. The accessibility is very limited for external students. It is indeed unfair for us since we need to spend extra time dealing with the connectivity issue.
                                    </p>
                            </li>

                                    I feel very frustrated when the first time trying to connect to the UQ zone. The configuration is all correct and I did make a successful connection for a short period. Then the connection soon lost due to an internet connectivity issue. One of my team members faces the same situation as me.
                                    </p>

                                <p>
                                    To work with this issue, I have to remotely connect another device then SSH to the zone VM. I have to spend twice more time debugging the same code as my peers located in Australia. The institution should have provided better solutions such as using Google cloud as a backup plan.
                                    </p>   
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    I think the reason being is that the course staff is not aware or convinced by the severity of this issue. Workarounds are provided but they are just workaround. It does not change the unfairness.
                                    </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    As a result, I’m a bit disappointed about the solution to this issue. I asked my team members all to set up a local testing environment based on Ubuntu to simulate the UQ zone.
                                    </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    I hope in the future the institution can consider more about fairness and provide infrastructures with higher availability.
