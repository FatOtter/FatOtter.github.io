# Tasks: Personal Portfolio Website

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-the-general-requirements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitution principle VII. All features must have corresponding test files in test/ directory.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Portfolio project**: `css/`, `script/`, `assets/`, `test/` at repository root
- **Backend**: `backend/` for Flask API services
- **Frontend**: Root level files (index.html, css/, script/, assets/)
- **Testing**: `test/frontend/` for browser tests, `test/backend/` for API tests
- Paths shown below assume portfolio structure - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure validation

- [x] T001 [P] Validate existing project structure (css/, script/, assets/, test/)
- [x] T002 [P] Verify existing index.html loads correctly in browser
- [x] T003 [P] Confirm existing assets/resume.md contains professional information
- [x] T004 [P] Validate existing assets/config.json configuration structure

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 [P] Enhance existing css/style.css with CSS variables for theming
- [x] T006 [P] Validate existing script/app.js functionality and structure
- [x] T007 [P] Ensure existing test/frontend/index.html test runner is functional
- [x] T008 [P] Verify existing test/backend/test_api.py test structure
- [x] T009 [P] Update assets/config.json with enhanced configuration options

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Professional Information Discovery (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enhance existing professional information display to ensure comprehensive and accessible presentation

**Independent Test**: Visitor can navigate through homepage sections and access complete professional information including education, work experience, skills, and contact details within 30 seconds

### Tests for User Story 1 (MANDATORY - required by constitution) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation. Tests are MANDATORY per constitution principle VII.**

- [x] T010 [P] [US1] Unit test for professional information display in test/frontend/test_professional_info.js
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Unit test for navigation functionality in test/frontend/test_navigation.js
- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Unit test for contact information accessibility in test/frontend/test_contact_access.js

- [x] T016 [US1] Add accessibility improvements to professional information sections
- [x] T017 [US1] Optimize existing assets/resume.md content structure for better display

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Multilingual Content Access (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enhance existing multilingual support to ensure seamless language switching and preference persistence

**Independent Test**: Visitor can switch between languages and verify all content is properly translated with language preference maintained across sessions

### Tests for User Story 2 (MANDATORY - required by constitution) ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [x] T018 [P] [US2] Unit test for language switching functionality in test/frontend/test_language_switching.js
- [x] T019 [P] [US2] Unit test for localStorage language preference persistence in test/frontend/test_language_persistence.js
- [x] T020 [P] [US2] Unit test for multilingual content consistency in test/frontend/test_multilingual_content.js

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T021 [US2] Enhance existing script/app.js language switching functionality
- [x] T022 [US2] Improve existing index.html data attributes for all three languages (zh/en/ja)
- [x] T023 [US2] Enhance existing css/style.css for multilingual typography and layout
- [x] T024 [US2] Optimize existing language detection and default selection logic
- [x] T025 [US2] Add missing translations for any incomplete language content

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Interactive Communication (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enhance existing chat functionality with improved UI, error handling, and backend integration

**Independent Test**: Visitor can initiate chat conversation and verify messages are exchanged successfully with appropriate responses and error handling

- [x] T026 [P] [US3] Unit test for chat UI functionality in test/frontend/test_chat_ui.js
- [x] T027 [P] [US3] Unit test for chat message handling in test/frontend/test_chat_messages.js
- [x] T028 [P] [US3] Integration test for backend API endpoints in test/backend/test_chat_api.py
- [x] T029 [P] [US3] Unit test for chat error handling in test/frontend/test_chat_errors.js

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T030 [US3] Enhance existing script/app.js chat functionality with improved UI
- [x] T031 [US3] Improve existing chat error handling and user feedback
- [x] T032 [US3] Enhance existing backend/app.py chat API endpoints

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (MANDATORY per constitution)
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority
- All tests MUST pass before any commit

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for professional information display in test/frontend/test_professional_info.js"
Task: "Unit test for navigation functionality in test/frontend/test_navigation.js"
Task: "Unit test for contact information accessibility in test/frontend/test_contact_access.js"

# Launch implementation tasks for User Story 1 in parallel:
Task: "Enhance existing index.html professional information sections"
Task: "Improve existing css/style.css for professional information presentation"
Task: "Enhance existing script/app.js navigation and scrolling functionality"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All tests MUST pass before any commit (constitution requirement)
- Focus on enhancing existing code with minimal modifications
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
