# Research: Personal Portfolio Website

**Feature**: Personal Portfolio Website  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

Based on analysis of the existing codebase and current_state.md, all technical decisions are already established and implemented. The research phase focuses on validating existing choices and identifying enhancement opportunities.

## Technical Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
**Decision**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+) with zero dependencies  
**Rationale**: 
- Aligns with constitution principle of zero-dependency frontend
- Existing implementation already functional and tested
- Maximum portability and simplicity
- No build process required

**Alternatives considered**: 
- React/Vue.js frameworks - Rejected due to dependency requirements
- Build tools (Webpack, Vite) - Rejected due to complexity and constitution constraints

### Multilingual Implementation
**Decision**: Data attributes (data-zh, data-en, data-ja) with localStorage persistence  
**Rationale**:
- Existing implementation already functional
- Lightweight and performant
- No external i18n libraries required
- Browser compatibility maintained

**Alternatives considered**:
- i18next library - Rejected due to dependency requirements
- Server-side language detection - Rejected due to frontend-only architecture

### Backend Integration
**Decision**: Optional Flask backend with graceful degradation  
**Rationale**:
- Existing backend structure already implemented
- RESTful API design follows best practices
- Optional nature ensures frontend independence
- Volcengine integration for chat functionality

**Alternatives considered**:
- Serverless functions - Rejected due to existing Flask implementation
- No backend - Rejected due to chat functionality requirements

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Browser-based testing (Mocha + Chai) for frontend, pytest for backend  
**Rationale**:
- Existing test infrastructure already functional
- Aligns with zero-dependency frontend principle
- Comprehensive coverage of critical functionality
- Easy to run and maintain

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest/Testing Library - Rejected due to dependency requirements
- Selenium/E2E testing - Rejected due to complexity for portfolio use case

### Styling and Design
**Decision**: CSS Variables with responsive design and accessibility focus  
**Rationale**:
- Existing styling foundation already established
- CSS Variables enable theme customization
- Responsive design ensures cross-device compatibility
- WCAG AA compliance for accessibility

**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS-in-JS solutions - Rejected due to dependency requirements
- Preprocessors (Sass/Less) - Rejected due to build process requirements

## Enhancement Opportunities

### Color Scheme Standardization
**Current State**: Basic dark theme with some CSS variables  
**Enhancement**: Complete CSS variable system with --primary color and derived variables  
**Impact**: Improved consistency and easier theme customization

### Chat UI Enhancement
**Current State**: Basic chat interface implemented  
**Enhancement**: Improved error handling, loading states, and user feedback  
**Impact**: Better user experience and professional appearance

### Performance Optimization
**Current State**: Good performance with existing implementation  
**Enhancement**: Font loading optimization, image compression, lazy loading  
**Impact**: Faster load times and better user experience

## Validation Results

All technical decisions align with:
- ✅ Constitution principles (zero-dependency frontend, structured organization)
- ✅ Existing codebase architecture
- ✅ Performance requirements (<2s load time, <2s language switching)
- ✅ Accessibility standards (WCAG AA compliance)
- ✅ Multilingual support requirements

## Conclusion

The existing technical foundation is solid and aligns with all constitutional requirements. The focus should be on enhancing current functionality rather than rebuilding, leveraging the existing codebase to maximum effect while maintaining the zero-dependency frontend principle.
