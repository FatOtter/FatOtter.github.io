# Implementation Plan: Personal Portfolio Website

**Branch**: `001-the-general-requirements` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-the-general-requirements/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Personal portfolio website showcasing professional information with multilingual support (Chinese, English, Japanese) and interactive chat functionality. The implementation leverages existing codebase structure with minimal changes, focusing on enhancing current features rather than rebuilding from scratch.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), Python 3.8+ (Flask backend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Flask, Mocha 10.2, Chai 4.3, Google Fonts (Inter, Noto Sans SC, Noto Sans JP), Font Awesome 6.5.x  
**Storage**: Local files (assets/resume.md), localStorage (language preferences), MySQL (optional chat persistence)  
**Testing**: Browser-based testing (Mocha + Chai), pytest (backend integration tests)  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers, mobile-responsive design  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + optional backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <2s initial page load, <2s language switching, <10s chat response time  
**Constraints**: Zero-dependency frontend, graceful backend degradation, WCAG AA accessibility  
**Scale/Scope**: Personal portfolio, ~1000 visitors/month, 3 languages, responsive design

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Zero-Dependency Frontend**: ✅ PASS - Feature uses existing vanilla HTML/CSS/JS implementation. No build process or package managers required. External dependencies (Google Fonts, Font Awesome) are CDN-based and optional.

**Structured Organization**: ✅ PASS - Feature maintains existing directory structure (css/, script/, assets/, test/). No new directories required as current structure already supports all functionality.

**Portfolio Focus**: ✅ PASS - Feature directly serves the primary purpose of showcasing professional information through enhanced multilingual support and interactive communication capabilities.

**Backend Integration**: ✅ PASS - Backend APIs are optional and gracefully degrade when unavailable. Chat functionality works without backend, and all core portfolio features are frontend-only.

**Multilingual Support**: ✅ PASS - Feature supports required languages (zh/en/ja) with existing data attributes and localStorage persistence implementation already in place.

### Post-Design Validation

**Design Phase Compliance**: ✅ PASS - All design artifacts (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md) maintain constitutional principles:
- Data model focuses on content presentation without complex database requirements
- API contracts follow RESTful patterns with graceful degradation
- Quickstart guide emphasizes zero-dependency frontend setup
- No additional dependencies or build processes introduced

**Structure Decision**: Leveraging existing portfolio website structure with frontend/backend separation. The current structure already supports all required functionality with minimal modifications needed. Frontend remains zero-dependency with optional backend for enhanced chat functionality.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
